# kibana-improvements

Chrome extension to override CSS on Kibana in order to see full names of field options in filter dropdown.

Note: I couldn't figure out how to match the URL specifically due to dynamic hostname, so I enabled this on all URLs.

To install, download zip file, go to `chrome://extensions`, click `Load unpacked` and select the directory.
