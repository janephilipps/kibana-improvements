# kibana-improvements

Chrome extension to override CSS on Kibana in order to:

- See full names of field options in filter dropdown
- See full stacktrace for easier copying out

Example reference: https://www.lateral.io/resources-blog/create-chrome-extension-modify-websites-html-css

Note: I couldn't figure out how to match the URL specifically due to the dynamic hostname, so I enabled this on all URLs for now.

To install, download zip file, go to `chrome://extensions`, make sure `Developer Mode` is on, click `Load unpacked` and select the directory (or drag directory directly into window).
